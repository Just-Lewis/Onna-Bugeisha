# Onna-Bugeisha
TDEMO Uni Project

GitIgnore is set to ignore starter content, may need to create another project and copy paste starter content to the same location. Should then have all needed essentials to get started.



   TODO
   
As this project develops, starter content will be phased out and so we need to plan where to store assets in folders.
This folder must be included in the gitignore or the source will grow far too large. Materials, objects and sounds must be updated manually.

Need a naming convention for assets that cannot be stored in the source. (sound, materials, objects)
